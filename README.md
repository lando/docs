# Lando Docs

This repo contains the [documentation site](https://docs.lando.dev) for [Lando](https://lando.dev). That said Lando is comprised of various constituent projects that are all combined together. So while this _is_ the main site you should think about it more as the "glue" that combines various subsites together into a cohesive docs expereince. Said more plainly. if you are looking to update the docs on say the Lagoon recipe then you should do so in the [Lagoon repo](https://github.com/lando/lagoon/tree/main/docs).

Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the other docs subsites:

* https://github.com/lando/cli/tree/main/docs
* https://github.com/lando/core/tree/main/docs
* https://github.com/lando/php/tree/main/docs
* https://github.com/lando/pantheon/tree/main/docs

However, it's best to just search for the repo you are looking for in the main [Lando org](https://github.com/lando) and consult its `README` on how to update its docs.
