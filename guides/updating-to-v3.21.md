# Updating to v3.21

However, before you begin here we *highly recommend* you check out the [v3.21 Release Blog Post](https://lando.dev/blog/2024/01/16/v321-extended.html) to get a higher level understanding on whats changed and why its changed in `v3.21`. After that you should be ready to get into the nitty gritty of what has changed.

**This guide is for people upgrading from `3.20.x` or lower**.

While `v3.21` does not _strictly_ have any breaking changes it does have some **BIG** changes that we've tried to document for you here.
