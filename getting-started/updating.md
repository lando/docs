# Updating

Updating is fairly simple.

1.  Shutdown Lando eg `lando poweroff` and kill any running Lando processes.
2.  Turn off Docker.
3.  Follow the normal installation steps with the new version.

If you run into any issues after that we recommend you check out this [troubleshooting guide](./../help/updating.md).
