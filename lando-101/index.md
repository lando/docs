Lando can isolate all your dev needs on a per app basis. This course will walk you through some examples of what can be accomplished with Lando development environments. If you have not installed Lando yet head over to [installing](/getting-started/installation.html) first.

Here is the outline of content the Lando 101 course will cover:

* [Init](/lando-101/lando-init.html)
* [Start](/lando-101/lando-start.html)
* [Configure](/lando-101/lando-config.html)
* [Add a Service](/lando-101/lando-services.html)
* [Add a Proxy URL](/lando-101/lando-proxy.html)
* [Add Tooling](/lando-101/lando-tooling.html)
* Add a Build step
* Add an Event

Throughout the Lando 101 course you'll see a number of hyperlinks in the text. These usually link to the full documentation or deep dives on a topic. We'd recommend that for your first read through that you simply ignore those links and go back to them after to deepen your understanding of Lando once you have the basics down.
